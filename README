This is an incomplete effort to implement iterative solvers with Intel ARBB. Tests are run with ./cg 500 and some results can be found from [1]. 

 * "original" is a version without ArBB
 * "sliced" has calls to ArBB from inside CG rather than the whole CG is one ArBB call. It is meant to be used with non-vectorizable preconditioners.
